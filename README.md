# Assignment 3 EGC - Lighting demo

Implemented in OpenGL and C++ a game that let's the user see different types of lighting: reflections, spotlights and direct lighting. The shader used is Phong Shading. The player can move around the scene. Every object in the scene is affected by the light and the dancers are moving using trigonometric functions. 

The standard WASD buttons are used as well as some other buttons for lighting mods
